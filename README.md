# Bizcuit ToDo

This project has been made for an interview at Bizcuit.

Since I had no previous experience with GraphQL and Apollo Client, it was a bit challenging but rewarding.

The app is able to list all the available projects that are stored on the server's memory. Also, for each project the user is able to add specific time data containing description and the amount of hours.

The user can add projects, view or edit. It is only able to view the time data for each project and delete them.

## Setup

- clone repository
- run `npm install`
- run `react-scripts start` to start the client
- run `node ./server/index.js` to start the server
